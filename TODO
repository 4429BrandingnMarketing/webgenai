# Milestones #

* F: Ideas and todo items for future versions

  This milestone holds all ideas/todo items/requests which are implemented some
  time in the future.


## Implementation (open) ##

* T001: what about fragment nodes? (created using a content processor, stored in cache, two webgen runs?)

* T002: add easy method for getting all useable ContentConverters

* T003: html validator should run after file written on .html files (configurable which files)

* T004: allow blocks processor to use a filename as argument

* T005: add ContentConverter which searches for wg-tagname="params" attributes and replaces them (see mail from andrew pietsch)

* T012: extend File/CopyHandler to allow arbitrary content processing before copying
  by encoding the to-be-used content processor into the filename, like default.erb.css or default.sass.css

* T014: extend Cli/Commands/About with an option to display all available parameters
  maybe this plugin should be renamed to `plugin about` once the plugin management features are implemented

* T015: add Cli/Commands/Use for applying a specific style to a website

* T016: add Cli/Commands/Check for checking the configuration file and possibly other things

### Implementation (closed) ###





## Bugs (open) ##

* T018: problem with regenerating pages when a new page got added to a menu
  doc.page (inMenu:true), index.page(inMenu:false) -> both pages are generated
  setting inMenu:true in index.page -> only index.page is regenerated
  -> menu plugin does not realize that new page has been added, every page where
  the new menu item appears has to be regenerated

* T006: see mail from andrew pietsch regarding menu issues/'tapestry.apache.org' feature

* T007: logging level is assigned after plugin bundles gets loaded in cli.rb/website.rb -> need a hook or something

* T011: source file naming convention does not allow files with dots in extension like .tar.gz

* T017: invalid language names are not recognized in file names

### Bugs (closed) ###




## Documentation (open) ##

* T008: add glossary page

  source file name, output file name, canonical name, localized canonical name

* T009: describe how the path patterns used in nodes_for_pattern work in section of naming of files.

* T010: think about examples in documentation



### Documentation (closed) ###
