title: Webgen::SourceHandler::Copy
summary: Copies files from the source to the output directory, optionally processing them with a
         content processor
---
## Description

This source handler copies path from the source to the output directory, optionally processing the
content with a content processor. It is used, for example, for CSS stylesheets, javascript files
and images.

This extension decides if and which content processor should be used by looking at the file
extension. If the short name of a content processor is the first part of the file extension, the
file is processed by this content processor and the first part is removed from the file extension.
Otherwise no processing is done at all. For example, a file named `hello.jpg` just gets copied
verbatimly but a file named `usage.erb.html` gets processed by the `erb` content processor and
written to a file named `usage.html`. As you can see in this example, the processor name gets
stripped from the file extension.

If you want to use a specific content processor for processing a file, have a look at its
documentation page which shows the unique short name that needs to be used in the file extension.
