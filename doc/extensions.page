# Extension Listing

Following is a listing of the available extensions that are shipped and can be used with webgen.

<%
describe = lambda do |ext|
  n = context.node.tree["#{File.join(context.node.parent.alcn, '/')}#{ext}"]
  "* #{context.dest_node.link_to(n)}: #{h(n['summary'])}"
end
%>

## Content Processors

These extensions process content, i.e. they either convert data from one format to another or make
other changes to the data. Content processors are used, for example, in the transformation pipeline
of page and template files.

It is not specified how content processors have to process the content, they are free to do
anything, even binary transformations (e.g. creating a thumbnail from a picture). This type of
extension can be divided into several groups:

Special purpose processors

: The following processors don't fit in any of the other categories
  below and perform very useful tasks which are nearly always used in the transformation pipeline of
  page/template files:

  <%= describe['contentprocessor/blocks.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/tags.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/fragments.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/head.en.html'] %>


Markup processors

: These processors convert markup text that is easy to read and write to a more
  structured format like HTML. This allows you to write an HTML page without knowing HTML.

  <%= describe['contentprocessor/kramdown.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/maruku.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/rdiscount.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/rdoc.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/redcloth.en.html'] %>


Template engines

: These processors are used to add dynamic parts to the processed content.

  <%= describe['contentprocessor/builder.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/erb.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/erubis.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/haml.en.html'] %>


CSS preprocessors

: These processors allow you to write CSS files in an easier way, for example,
  they allow the usage of variables to avoid spreading the same data over the whole file.

  <%= describe['contentprocessor/less.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/sass.en.html'] %>


Post processors

: These processors are used to post-process HTML files.

  <%= describe['contentprocessor/tidy.en.html'] %>
  <%= describe['contentprocessor/xmllint.en.html'] %>
