h2. Description

This file handler uses picture gallery description files to automatically build picture galleries.
These picture galleries are highly configurable and themeable through the use of page templates.

The gallery description files are written in YAML and specify

* which images should be used
* the titles/descriptions of the images
* the templates which should be used

TODO show an example gallery file
Here is a link TODO to such a demo picture gallery.
