h2. Description

This file handler uses picture gallery description files to automatically build picture galleries.
These picture galleries are highly configurable and themeable through the use of page templates.

The gallery description files are written in YAML and specify

* which images should be used
* the titles/descriptions of the images
* the templates which should be used
* meta information for the pages

This is the first version of the picture gallery handler, so do not expect too much!

h2. Examples

You can view an example gallery <a href="{relocatable: /Design_Gallery_1.html}">here</a>!
