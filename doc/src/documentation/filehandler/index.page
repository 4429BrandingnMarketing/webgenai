h2. Description

File handlers are used to handle different types of input files. You can see the currently exisiting
file handlers in the menu. Choose one to get a description for it!

Each file handler can handle one or more different file extensions. During the processing of the
website, files with a registered extension are processed by the corresponding file handler.

A special "file" handler is used to handle directories; this file handler registers the extension
@:dir@.
