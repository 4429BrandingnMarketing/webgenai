<p>The directory handler is used for processing directories. It creates the target directories and
an index file for each directory can be specified. If specified, this file is used instead of the
directory for displaying purposes. For example, the top level menu item for file handlers is
generated by the index file for the directory <code>filehandler</code>.</p>
