h2. Description

Page description files are used to specify the actual content for the website. The contain the
content for the webpage and, optionally, meta information.

h2(#structure). Structure

The format of these files is a very simple one and can be divided into two cases:

# Only content
# Meta information and content

A simple file may look like this:
<pre>
This is the content!!!
</pre>

Only content is specified in this file. Meta information can be specified at the beginning of the
file:
<pre>
\---
title: The title set by Meta info
\---
This is the content of the file
</pre>

In this example, meta information is specified ("more info":#meta). Note the three dashes at the
beginning of the file. This indicates that the following 'block' is used for meta information. If
the three dashes at the beginning are omitted, then the parser won't know that the following block
contains meta information and thinks it is content.

If you want to include a line in your file which only has three dashes, you have to write this:
<pre>
\\---
</pre>

The meta information is separated from the content by another three dashes and so the content itself
builds a second 'block'. The following examples contains three blocks, the meta information block
and two content blocks.
<pre>
\---
title: The title set by Meta info
\---
This is the 1. content of the file
\---
This is the 2. content of the file
</pre>

However, without naming blocks they cannot be accessed. You can specify the name and the content
formatting using meta information. Look at the following example:
<pre>
\---
title: The title set by Meta info
blocks:
  - \{name: content, format: textile}
  - \{name: sidebar, format: markdown}
\---
This is the 1. content of the file
\---
This is the 2. content of the file
</pre>

The first block in this file is named @content@ and formatted using @textile@. The second block is
named @sidebar@ and formatted using @markdown@.

h2. Content format

The content of page description can be written in different formats. The following formats are
currently available:

* textile: Content written using Textile markup ("Reference":http://hobix.com/textile/)
* markdown: Content written using Markdown markup ("Reference":http://www.deveiate.org)
* rdoc: Content written using RDOC markup (default documentation system for Ruby source files)
* html: Content in plain HTML

h2. Default settings

As page description files need not have meta information, defaults are used for needed parameters.
If meta information is specified in a page description file, the default values are overridden.

The following defaults are used:

* Content format

  If there is only content in a page description file, its formatting defaults to Textile markup.

* Title, ordering and language

  These values are taken from the filename, so the filename of a page description file has to be
  formatted like this: @[ordering.]title[.language].page@ (the values in square brackets are
  optional). In detail:
  * ordering: The ordering is a number which is used for menu generation and the like, where it is
    necessary to order the items. If not specified, defaults to @0@.
  * title: This is the title of the page. Hyphens and underscores are replaced with spaces and the
    title must not contain any dots.
  * language: This is the language code for this file. It is the international two letter acronym
    and if it is not specified, it defaults to @en@.

  Consider the following examples:
  * @name.page@ -> title: Name, language: en, ordering: 0
  * @name.de.page@ -> title: Name, language: de, ordering: 0
  * @01.name_of-file.de.page@ -> Title: Name of file, language: de, ordering: 01


h2(#meta). Meta Information

Meta information can be specified at the beginning of the file as described "here":#structure. Meta
information is formatted using YAML, a simple markup language. For more information about YAML, have
a look at the "www.yaml.org":http://www.yaml.org!

Any information can be specified. The most important use for meta information is to override values
like the title of the page (e.g. if you want dots in it), the ordering and so on. It is also used to
specify the names and the formatting of content blocks in the file.
