h2. About

This application is based on Qt > 3.1 and therefore needs the qtruby package. It is basically an
editor for editing webgen gallery description files. You can easily set all of the required
parameters and assign a title and a description to each image.

h2. How To Use

h3. Starting the editor

You can start the editor by calling @webgen-gallery-editor@. This opens up the main window.

<img src="{relocatable: /images/screenshots/wge-main.png}" alt="Main window when editing" title="Main Window when editing" />

At the beginning all widgets are disabled; they get enabled as soon as you create a new gallery
description file or open an existing one.

h3. Creating a new gallery description file

Select @File->New...@ which requires you to enter a name for the new gallery description file. All
the fields are filled with the default values. After that you can start editing!

h3. Editing gallery description files

You can specify the basic gallery information like gallery title, file pattern, ... in the upper
half of the main window. The meta information you specify for the main page gets included in the
main page; likewise the meta information you specify for the gallery pages gets included in every
gallery page.

The lower half of the main window consists of four parts

* *The list of images*:

  This list gets automatically updated whenever you change the file pattern. So you have a live
  preview of which images get included in the gallery. When you click on an image, it will be shown
  in the image preview pane. Also, the image meta information table and the title and description
  fields will be updated to show the current values for the selected image.

* *The image preview pane*:

  Here you will see the selected image. It will be scaled so that it fits into the available space,
  but it will not be enlarged if the space available is bigger than the image.

* *The image meta information*:

  Here you can enter additional meta information for the selected image.

* *Title and Description fields*:

  As these two meta information fields are used most often, they got their own widgets.


As entering the title and description for the images is the main use for the webgen gallery editor,
there is an easy way to do this:

# Select the first image.

# Enter a title in the title field. When you are finished press @CTRL+ENTER@. This will set the
  focus to the description field.

# Enter the description and when you are finished, press @CTRL+ENTER@ again. The next image will be
  selected and the focus wil be set to the title field so that you can continue describing the images.


h3. Using the meta information widgets

You need to specify the name of the meta information in the first column and the value in the second
column of the widget. You can only use certain kinds of values:

* Integer: just type a number
* String: just type the string
* Boolean: the special values @true@ and @false@ will be used as boolean values.
* Nil: the special value @nil@ will be used as nil value
