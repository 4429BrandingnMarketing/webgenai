h2. About

Tags are used to generate content. During processing of the page description files so called 'tags'
are substituted. For example, the menu you see to left was generated. This makes it easier to add or
remove menu items. If the menu was not generated, you would have to change every file which uses the
menu.

Webgen comes bundled with some default tag plugins. Have a look at the <a href="{relocatable: /api.html}">
API documentation</a> to get detailed information about a tag. All currently available
tags are exercised in this online demo. Choose a tag from the menu to get a short description of
what the tag does.

h2. Usage

Tags are defined by a special markup code. A tag has the following structure:

<pre class="webgen-file">\{tagname: {optional arguments in YAML format}}</pre>

Every time a tag is found in a source file, the registered plugin for the tag is called. The plugin
returns a string which is put into the output file instead of the tag. The output a tag plugin can
produce ranges from something simple to something complex. For example, the <a href="{relocatable: meta.html}">
Meta Tag</a> plugin copies any additional info specified in the source file verbatim
into the correct place in the output file. And in contrast, the <a href="{relocatable: menu.html}">
Menu Tag</a> plugin generates a whole menu tree.
