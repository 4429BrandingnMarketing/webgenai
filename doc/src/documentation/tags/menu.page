h2. Description

The menu tag is used to generate a menu for the website. You can see such a menu on the left of this
page. To get a list of all supported parameters for the menu tag, have a look at its API
documentation.

This page is available in <a href="{relocatable: menu.html/menu.de.html}">German</a>. Try and go to
the german version of this page. You will see that the menu items for which translations exist
change their names.

The menu to the left is generated with the default settings:

* level = 1
* subtreeLevel = 3
* showCurrentSubtreeOnly = true

Below are some other menus generated from the same source but with different settings:

table{border: 1px solid black}.
|^. \{menu: {subtreeLevel: 1}}{menu: {subtreeLevel: 1}}|^. \{menu: {showCurrentSubtreeOnly: false}} {menu: {showCurrentSubtreeOnly: false}}|
