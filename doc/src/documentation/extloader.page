h2. Description

The extension loader is used to load website specific extension plugins. Sometimes it is not useful
to extend webgen itself to support a new file format or another tag because the created plugins are
only useful for one specific site. So one can define these extensions in a configuration file and
then they are only available for the current website.

h2. The Configuration File

The configuration file for the extension loader has to be a file with valid Ruby code. Have a look
at the <a href="{relocatable: /api.html}">API</a> documentation to see which special methods you can
use in the configuration file.
