h2. Description

This plugin replaces smiley (ie. such sequences as <notextile>;-), :-)</notextile>, ...) with
emoticons - graphics which express the same emotion as the smiley.

You can enable or disable the replacement of smileys globally by setting the parameter @emoticonPack@
to an existing smiley package or @nil@. However, if a page has the meta information @emoticonPack@,
this meta info takes precedence over the global value. So, if the replacement is globally enabled,
you can disable it for a specifc page by setting the meta information @emoticonPack@ to @nil@ (this
was done for this page so that you can see the character representation of the smileys). You can
also change the used emoticon package for one page only by setting @emoticonPack@ to another
package name.

h2. Available Emoticon Packs

Here is a table showing the available smileys and their representation with various emoticons
packages. The header shows the smiley you have to use so that you get one of the emoticons below it,
depending on the used emoticon package.
