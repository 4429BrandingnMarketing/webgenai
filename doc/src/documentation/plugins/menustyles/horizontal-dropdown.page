h2. Description

Builds a horizontal menu with CSS drop down menus. This menu should work fine in any browser
supporting CSS and the @:hover@ selector (Mozilla based browsers like Firefox, Opera and Konqueror
are fine, newer IE browsers should also be fine).

h2. Style Advice

The menu works by only using CSS, not DHTML or anything else. Here is a list of CSS selectors and
descriptions how these selectors can be used to style various parts of the menu. You have to pay
attention to the last element in the selector (@ul@, @li@, or @a@). When you want to style menu
items, you normally want to use @a@. You should also be aware of the use of the @>@ sign, there is a
dramatic difference between writing @li a@ and @li > a@ (the former selecting ALL @a@ elements of
the list item, i.e. all @a@ elements in submenus too; and the latter only selecting the direct
descendant)!

h2. Example

Basic menu as it appears by default, nothing styled additionally with CSS:

<notextile>{menu: {menuStyle: horizontal-dropdown}}</notextile>

<br />
The same menu with a little CSS magic:

<notextile>{menu: {menuStyle: horizontal-dropdown, options: {divClass: horiz-dd-menu}}}</notextile>
