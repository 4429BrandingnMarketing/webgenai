h2(#description). Description

This plugin has two operation modes:

* All files that match the {param: File/CopyHandler:erbPaths} parameter are processed with ERB and
  then written out. The leading letter @r@ is stripped from the extension (e.g. @.rhtml@) to form
  the output file name. During processing with ERB the current @node@ object is available. This
  operation mode is useful, for example, for @.rhtml@ files (HTML with embedded ruby) or @.rcss@
  files (CSS files with embedded ruby).

* All files that match the {param: File/CopyHandler:paths} parameter are copied from the source to
  the output directory without modification. This is useful, for example, for CSS stylesheets,
  javascript files and images.

When a file matches against both parameters, it is handled as if it matches only against {param:
File/CopyHandler:erbPaths}.

Also note that files are written only if the source file is newer than the output file! This means
that, for example, images are copied only during the first webgen run and not during the second if
the image files have not changed.
