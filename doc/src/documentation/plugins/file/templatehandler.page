h2(#description). Description

The template handler processes the templates found in the source directory. Templates, as the name
already implies, normally specify the layout and the overall "picture" of a web page that is defined
using a page file.

These files have the same format as page files - more information about this format can be found
here (TODO(link) WebPage Description Format). Also be aware that the template handler uses the
content format set for the page handler! This is normally something like Textile or Markdown, if you
want to use plain HTML you have to explicitly specify it!

The parameter {param: File/TemplateHandler:defaultTemplate} specifies the name of the default
template which is used when no explicit template for a page file is set via the meta information
@template@. webgen assumes that the default template is in the same directory as the page file.
However, if it can not be found there, the parent directory is searched for it and so on. If a
default template isn't found in the root directory, no template is used at all. This means that when
you create a default template in the root directory, it is used as template for all page files that
have no explicit template set.

It is also possible to nest templates. This makes it possible, for example, to create a general
website layout and then to create a special image gallery layout which uses the general one. As the
template files have the same format as page files, you just need to set the @template@ meta
information on a template to specify the template in which it should be nested.

This page uses two templates: a general one which defines the overall layout of the website (the
menus and so on) and a specific plugin documentation template which provides the general information
section.
