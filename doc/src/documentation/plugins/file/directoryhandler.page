h2(#description). Description

The directory handler is used for handling directories, ie. it creates the target directories.
Additionally an index file for each directory can be specified. If it is specified, this file is
used instead of the plain directory index for displaying purposes. This means that when the
directory path is resolved (e.g. by the {plugin: Tag/Relocatable}) the index file is returned.

The name of the index file is specified with the @indexFile@ meta information on a directory node.
This meta information is set by default and can be overridden globally by using the special
@defaultMetaInfo@ param for the @DirectoryHandler@ in the "configuration file":TODO(link) or by
setting it on individual directories using the TODO(use new link tag) "meta information backing
file":{relocatable: ../core/filehandler.page#metainfo-backing}".

The title for a directory can be set via the @title@ meta information on the directory itself.
However, if the directory has an index file, the meta information @directoryName@ of the index file
is used for the directory title. This allows different directory names based on the current
language.

Normally, webgen shows a warning if it could not find the directory index file for a directory.
However, there are most certainly directories which should not have an index file, e.g. a directory
with only images. To prevent webgen from displaying warnings for such directories, you can set a
null index file using the meta information backing file:

<pre>
dirWithOnlyImages:
  indexFile: ~
</pre>

This will prevent webgen from showing warnings because you explicitly define a null index file. This
can also be done globally in the configuration file!
