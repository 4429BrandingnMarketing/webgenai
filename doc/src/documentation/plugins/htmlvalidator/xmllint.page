h2(#description). Description

This plugin uses the @xmllint@ program from the "libxml2":http://www.xmlsoft.org package. @xmllint@
can be used to validate an XML (and therefore an XHTML) file against a DTD, a RelaxNG schema or a
WXS schema. For more information about where to put the DTD or schema files, have a look at the
@libxml2@ documentation that comes bundled.
