h2. Description

This plugin uses the @xmllint@ program from the "libxml2":http://www.xmlsoft.org package. @xmllint@
can be used to validate an XML file against a DTD, a RelaxNG schema or a WXS schema. For more
information about where to put the DTD or schema files, have a look at the @libxml2@ documentation
that comes bundled.
