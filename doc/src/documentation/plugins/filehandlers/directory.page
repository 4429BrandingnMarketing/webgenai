h2. Description

The directory handler is used for processing directories. It creates the target directories and
additionally an index file for each directory can be specified. If specified, this file is used
instead of the plain directory index for displaying purposes. For example, the menu item for the
file handlers page is generated by the index file of the @filehandler@ directory.

Normally, webgen shows a warning if it could not find the directory index file for a directory.
However, there are most certainly directories which should not have an index file, e.g. a directory
with images only. To prevent webgen from displaying warnings for such directories, you can add the
following meta information to a backing file:

<pre>
dirWithOnlyImages:
  indexFile: ~
</pre>

This will prevent webgen from showing warnings because you explicitly define a null index file.

If you do not want to use directory index files, you can set the parameter @indexFile@ to @nil@ in
the configuration file, like this:

<pre>
DirHandler:
  indexFile: ~
</pre>
