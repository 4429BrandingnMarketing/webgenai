h2. Description

The FileHandler plugin is one of the two main workhorses, the other being the {plugin:
Core/TagProcessor}. When running webgen the FileHandler is responsible for traversing the source
directory and creating the internal representation of all handled files as well as writing the
output files by using the individual file handler plugins. These file handler plugins reside in the
{plugin: File} namespace.

There are many different file handler plugins available, ranging from very simple ones, like copying a
file verbatim from the source to the output directory, to complicated ones, like creating HTML files
from page files or creating whole image galleries from a simple gallery defintion file!

h2. Path Patterns

Each file handler plugin specifies path patterns which are used to locate the files that the plugin
can handle. Normally these patterns are used to match file extensions, however, they are much more
powerful. For detailed information have a look at
"Dir.glob":http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Dir.html#M002375 .

The path patterns that are handled by a particular file handler plugin are stated on its
documentation page and cannot be changed for most plugins, eg. the {plugin: File/PageHandler} will
always handle @.page@ files. However, the information about how these path patterns work are useful
for the usage of webgen because of two reasons:

* so that the user knows which files will be processed by a specific file handler plugin
* so that the user can specify path patterns for some special file handler plugin that supports
  additional path patterns, like the {plugin: File/CopyHandler}.

Here are some examples:

<table class="examples">
<tr><th>Path Pattern</th><th>Result</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td><notextile><code>*/*.html</code></notextile></td>
  <td>All files with the extension @html@ in the subdirectories of the source directory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><notextile><code>**/*.html</code></notextile></td>
  <td>All files with the extension @html@ in all directories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><notextile><code>**/{foo,bar}*</code></notextile></td>
  <td>All files in all directories which start with @foo@ or @bar@</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><notextile><code>**/???</code></notextile></td>
  <td>All files in all directories whose file name is exactly three characters long</td>
</tr>
