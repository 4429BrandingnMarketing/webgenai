h2(#description). Description

The TagProcessor plugin, apart from the {plugin: Core/FileHandler}, is the main workhorse. It is
responsible for parsing HTML content and replacing special constructs, so called tags, with dynamic
content. For more information on how these tags look like, how they are used and why they are
useful, have a look at the <a href="{relocatable: /documentation/references/webpage_format.page}">page file format description</a>!

Each tag has a unique name and an associated handler plugin. Therefore it is very easy to define new
tags. webgen already comes with many tag plugins that handle simple things, like including a file,
to advanced things, like generating a menu (the menus used on this homepage are generated
dynamically with webgen). These tag plugins reside in the {plugin: Tag} namespace.
