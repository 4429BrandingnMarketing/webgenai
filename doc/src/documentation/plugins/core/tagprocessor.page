h2(#description). Description

The TagProcessor plugin, apart from the {plugin: Core/FileHandler}, is the main workhorse. It is
responsible for parsing HTML content and replacing special constructs, so called tags, with dynamic
content. For more information on how these tags look like, how they are used and why they are
useful, have a look at the <a href="TODO">page file content description</a>!

Each tag has a unique name and an associated handler plugin. Therefore it is very easy to define new
tags. webgen already comes with many tag plugins that handle simple things, like including a file,
to advanced things, like generating a menu (the menus used on this homepage are generated
dynamically with webgen). These tag plugins reside in the {plugin: Tag} namespace.


TODO move to page file content description#tags

Tags are used to generate content. During processing of the page description files so called 'tags'
are replaced with dynamic content. For example, the menu you see to left was generated. This makes
it easier to add or remove menu items. If the menu was not generated, you would have to change every
file which uses the menu.

h2. Usage

Tags are defined by a special markup code. A tag has the following structure:

<pre>\{tagname: {parameters}}</pre>

Every time a tag is found in a source file, the registered plugin for the tag is called. The plugin
returns a string which is put into the output file instead of the tag. The output a tag plugin can
produce ranges from something simple to something complex. For example, the <a href="{relocatable: meta.page}">
Meta Tag</a> plugin copies any additional info specified in the source file verbatim
into the correct place in the output file. And in contrast, the <a href="{relocatable: menu.page}">
Menu Tag</a> plugin generates a whole menu tree.

If you want to use the markup code used for tags, you need to escape the tag, like this:

<pre>\\\{tagname: {parameters}}</pre>


h2. Tag Parameters

A tag can have zero or more parameters some of which are mandatory. You can see the supported
parameters (and if they are mandatory) for each tag on the tag's page. The default mandatory
parameter can be specified in a special way, see the examples below. The format used for parsing the
parameters is YAML.

h2. Examples

table{border: 1px solid black}.
|^. @\{tagname: }@|^. No parameter specified|
|^. @\{tagname: test.html}@|^. The default mandatory parameter is set to @test.html@. This form can only be used if there is only one mandatory parameter|
|^. @\{tagname: {param1: value1, param2: value2}}@|^. Two parameters (param1 and param2) specified|
