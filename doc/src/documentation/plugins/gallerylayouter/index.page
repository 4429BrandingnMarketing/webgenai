h2. About

Gallery layouters are used to define layouts for galleries. Each plugin defines how the main page,
the gallery pages and the picture pages look like. To do this, each plugin has to define three methods:

* <tt>main( data )</tt>
* <tt>gallery( data, gIndex )</tt>
* <tt>picture( data, gIndex, iIndex )</tt>

The @data@ parameter is a @Hash@ with all the information available about the gallery. The @gIndex@
and the @iIndex@ parameters are indices for the current gallery and the current image.
