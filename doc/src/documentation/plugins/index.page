h2. About

All available plugins in the distribution are described in this section. Choose a plugin category
to get more information!

h2. Plugins

webgen is written with extensibility in mind; therefore most of its features are implemented with
plugins, only the core functions are not plugins.

Writing your own plugins is not difficult, too! If you need a specific functionality, implement a
plugin and put it under the site specific @plugin@ directory - then the plugin gets loaded with the
others. It's so easy!

For more information have a look at the <a href="{relocatable: /rdoc/index.html}">API documentation</a>!

h2. Parameters

Each plugin can define parameters which can be used to configure the plugin. These parameters are
listed in the "Information" section of each plugin page. Also note that plugins can use the
parameters from their "super plugins" - this allows a group of plugins which have similar
functionality (e.g. the menu style plugins) to share common configuration values. The names of the
"super plugins" are enclosed in parentheses after the plugin name in the "Information" section.
