h2. Plugins

webgen is written with extensibility in mind; therefore most of its features are implemented with
plugins, only the core functions are not plugins.

Writing your own plugins is not difficult, too! If you need a specific functionality, implement a
plugin and put it under the site specific @plugin@ directory - then the plugin gets loaded with the
others. It's so easy!

For more information have a look at the <a href="{relocatable: /rdoc/index.html}">API documentation</a>!
