h2. Description

The ResourceManager plugin is used to define and access various resources. A resource is identified
via the resource name and is written to a certain output path (relative to the output directory).
There are two different types of resources: file resources and memory resources.

*   A *file* resources references a certain file which gets copied to its output path when webgen is
    writing out all files. These files resources can refernce any kind of file (images, videos,
    audio files, HTML files,...).

*   A *memory* resource only exists during a run of webgen. Plugins can use such resources to provide
    additional information, such as CSS formatting rules or Javascript.

Resources are only written to the output path if they are referenced (i.e. their output path is
included in a page file) at least once by the <a href="{relocatable: ../tags/resource.page}">resource
tag</a>.

h2. Predefined Resources

webgen provides some predefined resources which can be used by any website created with it.
