h2. Description

The directory handler is used for processing directories. It creates the target directories and
additionally an index file for each directory can be specified. If specified, this file is used
instead of the plain directory index for displaying purposes. For example, the menu item for the
file handlers page is generated by the index file of the @filehandler@ directory.
