h2. Description

File handlers are used to handle different types of input files. You can see the currently exisiting
file handlers in the menu. Choose one to get a description for it!

Each file handler specifies path patterns or extensions for the files he handles. During the
processing of the website, the FileHandler instance calls the approriate file handler for each file
and builds the internal representation of the source directory.

h2. Path Patterns

Path patterns are more like shell globs than regular expressions. One can use any path pattern that
the @Dir.glob@ method understands. If two path patterns would match the same path, the one with
fewer asterisks and question marks is used because that one "seems" to be more specific.


Here are some examples:

table{border: 1px solid black}.
|^. <notextile><code>*/*.html</code></notextile>|^. All files with the extension @html@ in the subdirectories of the root source directory|
|^. <notextile><code>**/*.html</code></notextile>|^. All files with the extension @html@ in all directories|
|^. <notextile><code>**/{foo,bar}*</code></notextile>|^. All files in all directories which start with @foo@ or @bar@|
|^. <notextile><code>**/???</code></notextile>|^. All files in all directories whose file name is exactly three characters long|
