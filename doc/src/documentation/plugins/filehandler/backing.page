h2. Description

The backing file handler is used to set meta information for other files. It can be used to set
additional meta information for page description files. However, its main purpose is to add virtual
pages and directories.

h2. File Format

The files are written in YAML and have a very easy structure:
<pre>
filename1.en.page:
  title: File one
  orderInfo: 45
  additional_metainfo: my_used_value

filename1.de.page:
  title: German version of File one

docu/external.html:
  dest: http://www.my-homepage.com
  title: My external homepage
  inMenu: true
</pre>

As you can see, you use the name of a file as top level key and then you specify every meta
information you want. You can use relative and absolute paths in the filenames. However, you cannot
specify meta information for files which are in one of the parent directories of the backing file.

If you want to set meta information for an existing page description file, you have to use the
<a href="{relocatable: pagehandler.page#naming}">standardified name</a> of that page description
file (e.g. @filename1.page@ or @filename1.de.page@).

Using backing files you can add virtual files and directories. If the file specified in the entry
does not exist, a node for that file will be created. This will also create the whole directory tree
this virtual node is in. It allows you, for example, to add external items to the menu. In this case
you need to specify the +dest+ meta information which points to the actual location of the
referenced page.
