h2. Description

The backing file handler is used to set meta information for other files. It can be used to set
additional meta information for page description files. However, its main purpose is to add virtual
pages and directories.

h2. File Format

The files are written in YAML and have a very easy structure:
<pre>
filename1.en.html:
  metainfo1: value1
  metainfo2: value2
filename1.de.html:
  metainfo21: value21
</pre>

Your can use relative and absoulte paths in the filenames. However, you cannot specify meta
information for files which are in one of the parent directories of the backing file.

Using backing files you can add virtual files and directories. If the file specified in the entry
does not exist, a node for that file will be created. This will also create the whole directory tree
this virtual node is in. It allows you, for example, to add external items to the menu. You need
to specify the +dest+ meta information which points to the actual location of the referenced page.
