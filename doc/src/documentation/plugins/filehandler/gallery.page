h2. Description

This file handler uses image gallery description files to automatically build image galleries.
These image galleries are highly configurable and themeable through the use of page templates.

h2. Gallery Description Files

The gallery description files have YAML as file format and can either be written by hand or can be
edited using the <a href="{relocatable: /documentation/webgen_gallery_editor.page}">webgen-gallery-editor</a>.

A gallery description file specifies

* which images should be used
* the titles/descriptions of the images
* the templates which should be used
* meta information for the pages
* the layout

The two most important things on this list are which images should be used and the layout. The
images have to be in the website source directory! You can/should not specify images outside the
source directory as these images are not automatically copied to the destination directory and
automatice thumbnail creation may not work correctly. And the layout defines how the main, gallery
and image pages look like.

Here is an example gallery description file:
<pre>
title: Example Gallery
imagesPerPage: 32
files: example/**/*.jpg

mainPage:
    inMenu: false
    template: hello.template
    metainfo: is defined here

galleryPages:
    metainfo: is defined here

example/dir1/img1.jpg:
    title: Test title
    description: Long description of image

example/img2.jpg
    title: Title2 of pic
</pre>

So, we define the title of the gallery first and change the @picsPerPage@ setting. Every plugin
parameter can be changed by using its name as key and assigning a new value to it. The key
@mainPage@ can be used to set meta information for the main page. Likewise, the key @galleryPages@
can be used to set meta information for the gallery pages and if the key is the name of an image,
its value is used as meta information for the image.

You can specify the order of the images by setting the @orderInfo@ meta information on the images.
Normally, the images are sorted by their title or, if no title was entered, by their filename. By
setting the @orderInfo@ meta information you can reorder them.

h2. Types of Generated Pages

There are three different page types:

* *main page*: It should have a list of all galleries. It is not generated if there is only
  one gallery; this gallery becomes the main page.

* *gallery pages*: Each gallery page should have a list of all the images on it. The number of
  images per gallery page can be defined via a parameter.

* *image pages*: Each image page should display its image and, maybe, additional information.

h2. Layouter plugins

Each layouter plugin defines a different "style" of image gallery. Have a look at the available
layouter plugins and choose one for your image gallery. If you think they do not look good enough,
you can define your own layouter in the extension file. You only need to derive a new class from
DefaultGalleryLayouter and define the layout methods.
