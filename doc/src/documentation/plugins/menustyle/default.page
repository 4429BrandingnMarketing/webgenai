h2(#description). Description


This is the base plugin for all menu styles which are used by the {plugin: Tag/Menu} plugin. Menu
Styles are used to build different types of menus. Some web sites use vertical menus on the left or
right side, some horizontal menus at the top. It's up to you to chose the best suited menu style for
your website!

This plugin defines some parameters that are used by the individual menu style plugins sothat
the generated menus can be styled more easily with CSS.

Have a look at the individual menu styles for more information!
