h2. Information

<notextile>{describe: PartialMenuStyle}</notextile>

h2. Description

Builds a simple menu showing only the menu levels under the current page. This means that if you are
in the third level of the hierarchy, the first two menu levels are not shown.

h2. Style Advice

The menu is constructed using HTML lists with @ul@ and @li@ tags. However, the menu looks better if
no discs are shown for the menu items (using <code>list-style-type: none</code>).

h2. Examples

Basic menu as it appears by default, nothing styled additionally with CSS:

<notextile>{menu: {menuStyle: partial}}</notextile>

The same menu with a little CSS magic:

<notextile>{menu: {menuStyle: partial, options: {divClass: partial-menu}}}</notextile>
