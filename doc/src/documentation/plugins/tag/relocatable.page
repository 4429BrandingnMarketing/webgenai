h2. Description

The relocatable tag is used to change the path of the supplied file and is most often used in
template files. A relocatable tag looks like this: @\{relocatable: default.css}@. If this
was put into a template and the template was used by a file in a subdirectory, then the
@relocatable@ tag would put @../default.css@ into the output file.

This ensures that the relative path to the referenced file is always correct.
