h2(#description). Description


The menu tag is used to generate a dynamic menu for the website. You can see such a menu on the left
of this page.

It uses the meta information @inMenu@ and @orderInfo@ to determine which pages should be in the menu
and how they should be ordered. Then it generates an internal menu tree, one for each language, to
speed up menu generation. When the tag is used, it is first determined which language tree should be
used for the menu generation (the language of the page the menu tag appears in). After that a
specific menu style is used to actually generate the menu.


h2(#menustyle). Menu Styles


There exist serveral different predefined menu styles (vertical, horizontal, ...). Have a look at
the {plugin: MenuStyle} section to see which menu styles are available.


h2(#static). Static Menus

It is also possible to define a "static" menu or to augment the dynamic menu with static entries by
using the <a href="../core/filehandler.page#metainfo-file">meta information backing file</a>.
Following are some ideas for how to do this. Nothing is assumed, so it is valid that none or some
page files have the @inMenu@ meta information set:

* Exisiting page files can be included in the menu by specifying the needed meta information
  directly (either in the source or the output section):

  <pre>
    features.page:
      inMenu: true
      orderInfo: 1
  </pre>

* Virtual files and directories can be added using the output section to structure the menu the
  way you like it. This way it is also possible to add one page under two different headings:

  <pre>
    newdir:
      orderInfo: 2       -> no need to specify inMenu if page under dir have it specified

    newdir/new.page:
      orderInfo: 1       -> orderInfo for the page
      inMenu: true       -> it should be in the menu
      lang: en           -> lang has to be set explicitly if the file does not exist, and if
                            the file should only appear in the menu for one specific language:
                            if not set, it appears in every menu
      url: ../features.page  -> ../features.page is shown for this menu entry
  </pre>

A completely "static" menu can be generated by only using virtual directories and files in the
output section and not setting @inMenu@ for any node.
