h2. Description

The language tag is used to display a list of languages for a page. Take a look at the lower right
corner of the header. There you will find a link titled 'en'. This is the link to the english (=en)
version of this page. As this page is not translated into any other language, there is only this one
item.

h2. Examples

Here is a <a href="{relocatable: multilang.html}">link</a> to a page which is translated to several
languages (more or less ;-). Have a look at it and don't forget to view the page in the other
languages!
