h2. Information

p={font-size: 150%; color: red}. *!!! This documentation is for webgen {version: } !!!*

The source files for this website are in the @doc/src@ directory of the webgen package. Have a look
at them to see a real world example on how to use webgen!

h2. Philosophy

There are some things about webgen which I think are important to mention. It's about how webgen
works and what you can expect when you start webgen.

* <b>webgen runs till the end and does not stop on errors!</b>

  I did not like it when webgen stopped because there was an error in the configuration file or an
  error in a page description file. So if something exceptional happens it is logged so that the
  user can see what happened and a useful default alternative is used instead. For example, if no
  default template was found in the source directory, a dummy template is used instead.

  Therefore it is also not necessary to install the dependencies (although you would be wise to do
  it, so that you can use all the features of webgen). If a dependency is not found (e.g. RedCloth
  for Textile support), the specific feature is turned off and a warning gets issued.

* <b>Useful default values for everything!</b>

  You _do not need_ to configure webgen if you are happy with the default values. webgen provides
  default values for every configuration option.

* <b>Every important thing gets logged!</b>

  The logging mechanism is not only used to log error and warning messages, but also to log
  informational and debug messages. For the normal user, the error and warning messages are
  important. Developers who extend webgen by writing a new plugin can use the informational and
  debug messages to see what is going on and to help them develop the plugin.

h2. Configuration

webgen provides a default configuration out of the box. If you can live with that, you do not need
to write any configuration files. Because most people cannot, you can use your own configuration
file. The configuration file has to be written in YAML and is called @config.yaml@. webgen searches
in the current directory for the configuration file.

If you want to get the configuration values you can run webgen like this
<pre>
  $ webgen show config
</pre>

The list shows sorted by the plugin name the current values and the default values for each
configuration option. Each option can be overridden in the configuration file by specifing the
plugin name as top level key and each configuration option as a key/value pair. A configuration file
looks like this:

<pre class="webgen-file">{includeFile: /../../../testsite/config.yaml}</pre>
