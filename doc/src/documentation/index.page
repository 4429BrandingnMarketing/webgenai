h2. Preface


p={font-size: 150%; color:red}. *This documentation is for webgen {version: }! However, most parts
are valid for all webgen 0.4.x releases!*


The source files for this website are in the @doc/src@ directory of the webgen distribution. Have a
look at them to see a real world example on how to use webgen!


h2. Spelling of the name "webgen"


I often see that the name of the program is misspelled: WebGen, Webgen, WEBGEN, ... It is just
*webgen*, all lower case!


h2. Philosophy of webgen


There are some things about webgen which I think are important to mention. It's about how webgen
works and what you can expect when you start webgen.

* <b>webgen runs till the end and does not stop on errors!</b>

  I did not like it when webgen stopped because there was an error in the configuration file or an
  error in a page file. So if something exceptional happens it is logged so that the user can see
  what happened and a useful default alternative is used instead. For example, if no default
  template was found in the source directory, a dummy template is used instead.

  Therefore it is also not necessary to install the dependencies (although you would be wise to do
  it, so that you can use all the features of webgen). If a dependency is not found (e.g. RedCloth
  for Textile support), the specific feature is turned off and a warning gets issued.

* <b>Useful default values for everything!</b>

  You _do not need_ to configure webgen if you are happy with the default values. webgen provides
  default values for every configuration option.

* <b>Every important thing gets logged!</b>

  The logging mechanism is not only used to log error and warning messages, but also to log
  informational and debug messages. For the normal user, the error and warning messages are
  important. Developers who extend webgen by writing a new plugin can use the informational and
  debug messages to see what is going on and to help them develop the plugin.
