<p>File handlers are used to handle different types of input files. One can distinguish between
normal file handlers and page file handlers: page file handlers are used to handle page description
files (which describe HTML files, like this one), all other files are handled by normal file
handlers.</p>
<p>You can see the currently exisiting file handlers in the menu. Choose one to get a short
description for it!</p>
