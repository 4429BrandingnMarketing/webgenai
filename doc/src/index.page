## Welcome to the homepage of _webgen_!

webgen is a command line application for generating static websites. You could write a static
website by hand, of course. But by using webgen you have several advantages:

* The page layout is separated from the content: if you change the layout, all pages are
  automatically updated.

* The content files can be written in a markup language like Markdown or Textile.

* webgen can automatically generate, for example, menus and breadcrumb trails for you.

* Dynamic content can easily be added to content files.

* webgen web sites are self contained since all generated links are relative ones.

The above list should just give you a glimpse of what is possible with webgen. Have a look at the
[features page]({relocatable: features.html}) for a more complete list.

Although webgen is very powerful it is also very easy to use. A basic website can be created in just
one step by executing `webgen create mywebsite`. This command will create the directory `mywebsite`
which houses the newly created webgen website and some content files to start with. By running the
command `webgen` inside the `mywebsite` directory, the website will be generated and put into the
`output` directory where it can be viewed with any browser.

Actually, this website was generated with webgen and provides an online demonstration of its
features. For example, the menu that you can see at the top was created dynamically. For more
information have a look at the [documentation]({relocatable: /documentation/})!

## Download & Installation

webgen should run on any platform which supports Ruby. It has been successfully tested on the
following platforms:

* Linux with Ruby 1.8.6
* Mac OSX with Ruby 1.8.6
* Windows XP with Ruby 1.8.5 (1.8.6 has a bug that prevents webgen from working correctly)

### Using Rubygems

If you are using Rubygems, installing webgen is as simple as executing `gem install webgen`. After
this command has finished, everything is ready for creating websites. Be sure to have a look at the
optional dependencies which are needed for some plugins.

### Manual Installation

The latest version of webgen can always be downloaded from [webgen's Files section on
Rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=296). After the download the package needs to be
decompressed and then you can install webgen using the included `setup.rb` installation method:

    $ ruby setup.rb config
    $ ruby setup.rb setup
    $ ruby setup.rb install

Make sure that you also install the mandatory and, if you need them, the optional dependencies.

### Dependencies

* (mandatory) [cmdparse](http://cmdparse.rubyforge.org) version 2.0.0 or higher

* (mandatory) [facets](http://facets.rubyforge.org) version 2.0.2 or higher

------------------- TODO -------------------------

* (optional) "RMagick":http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/ version 1.7.1 or higher if you want automatic
  thumbnail creation for image galleries

All these libraries can be installed via Rubygems (which I recommend).
