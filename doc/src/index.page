h2. About _webgen_

webgen is used to generate web pages from page and template files. You create one or more template
files in which you define the layout of your page and where the content should go. After that you
create page files in which you only define the content.

When webgen is run it combines the template with each of the page files and generates the HTML
output files. During this process special tags are substituted so that, for example, a menu is
generated. Actually, this website was generated with webgen and, for example, the menu that you can
see was created dynamically. For more information look at the documentation!

This whole site was generated with webgen and provides an online demonstration of its features.
Choose from the menu what you want to see from or know about webgen!
