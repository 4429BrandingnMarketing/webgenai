h3(#news-2007-01-05). 05.01.2007 - webgen 0.4.0


This is a major release with many updates to the webgen core, the plugins and the documentation.
Plugins written for prior version won't work with this one anymore. However, changing them to work
again is easy. As an upgrade guide is currently not available have a look at webgen plugins and the
API documentation to see how to do upgrade plugins.

* Speed-up through caching of node information
* New and cool gallery style
* New content converter plugin ({plugin: ContentConverter/XmlBuilder})
* New plugin for syntax highlighting ({plugin: Misc/SyntaxHighlighter})
* Many changes to the core (plugin system revised, webgen can now be used from other Ruby applications directly, faster node resolution, hooks are now spelled with only lowercase letters, ...)
* Structure of meta information @blocks@ changed
* New meta information @linkAttrs@ for setting additional attributes on links
* Handling and structure of meta information backing file changed
* Evaluation of page files changed (first converted to HTML, then ERB, then webgen tags)
* "Static" menus now available
* New sub-commands for the webgen command
* Gallery editor application deprecated.
* Many tests have been added.
* Documentation on the homepage as well as the API documentation is now more complete
