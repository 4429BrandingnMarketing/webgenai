h2. About _webgen_

Webgen is used to generate web pages from page description and template files. You create one
template file in which you define the layout of your page and where the content should go. After
that you can create page description files in which you only define the content.

When webgen is run it combines the template with each of the page description files and generates
the HTML output files. During this process special tags are substituted so that, for example, a menu
is generated. Actually, this page was generated with webgen and, for example, the menu that you can
see was created dynamically. For more information look at the documentation!
