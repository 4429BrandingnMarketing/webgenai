webgen - a template based static website generator

Copyright (C) 2006 Thomas Leitner

>>> The documentation for webgen is in the doc/src subdirectory. <<<

You can build the documentation by executing
 $ rake doc

in the root of the package. This command will build the documentation and place it in doc/output.

This documentation is actually the same as the one on http://webgen.rubyforge.org. When releasing a new
version of webgen, I run one of the above commands to create the pages and then only copy it to the
website! :-)
