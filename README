webgen - a template based web page generator

Copyright (C) 2004 Thomas Leitner

>>> The documentation for webgen is in the doc/src subdirectory. <<<

You can build the documentation by
invoking
 $ rake doc

in the root of the package or by running webgen manually in the +doc+ directory:
 $ ruby -I../lib ../bin/webgen

This documentation is actually the same as the one on webgen.rubyforge.org. When releasing a new
version of webgen, I run one of the above commands to create the pages and then only copy it to the
website! :-)
