Description
-----------

The meta tag is used to copy meta information verbatim. For example, if
you define a meta information with the key `revision`, you can put the
tag `\{revision:}` into a block of a page file and the value gets
substituted automatically.

An every day usage example for the meta tag would be including the title
of a page in the `head`-section of a HTML template.
