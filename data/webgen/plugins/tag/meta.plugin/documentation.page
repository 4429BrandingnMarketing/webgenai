Description
-----------

The meta tag is used to copy meta information verbatim to the output
file. For example, if you define a meta information with the key
`revision`, you can put the tag `\{revision:}` into a block of the page
file and the value gets substituted automatically.

An every day usage example for the meta tag would be including the title
of a page in the `head`-section of a HTML template.
