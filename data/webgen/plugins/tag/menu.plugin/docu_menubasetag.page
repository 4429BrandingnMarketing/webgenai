The MenuBaseTag is the base plugin for menu tag plugins which are used
to generate a dynamic menu for a page. It is also used to hold the
parameters that are used by all menu tag plugins and it provides default
implementations for some methods.

A menu tag plugin uses the meta information `inMenu` and `orderInfo` to
determine which pages should be in the menu and how they should be
ordered. A separate menu tree is used for each language.

It is also possible to define a "static" menu or to augment the dynamic
menu with static entries by using the meta information backing file.
Following are some ideas for how to do this. Nothing is assumed, so it
is valid that none or some page files have the `inMenu` meta information
set:

*   Exisiting page files can be included in the menu by specifying the
    needed meta information directly (either in the source or the output
    section):

        features.page:
          inMenu: true
          orderInfo: 1

*   Virtual files and directories can be added using the output section to
    structure the menu the way you like it. This way it is also possible
    to add one page under two different headings:

        newdir:
          orderInfo: 2

        newdir/new.page:
          orderInfo: 1
          inMenu: true
          lang: en
          url: ../features.page

     There is no need to specify `inMenu` for `newdir` if a page under
     the directory is in the menu. Also be aware that you need to set
     the language explicitly if the file should only appear in the menu
     for the specific language. Otherwise it appears in every menu. The
     `url` key can be used to specify the page that should be shown when
     clicked on the generated link.

A completely "static" menu can be generated by only using virtual
directories and files in the output section and not setting `inMenu` for
any other node.

One can't use this plugin directly since it defines no tag name. The
default implementation of a menu tag plugin is Tag/VerticalMenu. If you
want to develop a menu tag plugin, have a look at the RDoc documentation
for this plugin class.
