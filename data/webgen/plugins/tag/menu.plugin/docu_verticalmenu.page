Description
-----------

This menu tag plugin builds a seemingly simple menu using HTML
lists. However, it is very flexible due to its many parameters that let
you decide every detail of the menu. For general information about menu
tag plugins have a look at the documentation of Tag/MenuBaseTag.

> The menu is constructed using HTML lists with `ul` and `li` tags.
> However, the menu normally looks better if no discs are shown for the
> menu items (using the CSS directive `list-style-type: none`).

It can also be used for generating an in-page content menu of all the
header sections. Just set the parameter Tag/VerticalMenu:useTypes to
`fragments`.

> When using `useTypes=normal`, all nodes which are only in the menu
> because they have fragment nodes beneath them are not included in the
> menu.
