Description
-----------

This menu tag plugin builds a seemingly simple menu using HTML
lists. However, it is very flexible due to its many parameters that let
you decide every detail of the menu. For general information about menu
tag plugins have a look at the documentation of Tag/MenuBaseTag.

> The menu is constructed using HTML lists with `ul` and `li` tags.
> However, the menu normally looks better if no discs are shown for the
> menu items (using the CSS directive `list-style-type: none`).
