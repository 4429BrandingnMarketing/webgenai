Description
-----------

This tag ensures that the relative path to the specified path is always
correct.

It is used to change the directory part of the supplied path name and is
most often used in template files. A relocatable tag looks like this:
`\{relocatable: default.css}`. If this was put into a template and the
template was used by a file in a subdirectory, then the `relocatable`
tag would put `../default.css` into the output file; thus ensuring that
the relative path to file is valid.

> You can only use the `relocatable` tag with files/paths that are
> handled by webgen. This should be no problem since all files in the
> source directory are normally handled by webgen.
{.exclamation}

However, if the specified path is an absolute URL, it will just return it.

Additionally, if you add an URL fragment to the path, it will also be
checked if it exists. This can be turned off by setting the parameter
Tag/Relocatable:resolveFragment to `false`.
