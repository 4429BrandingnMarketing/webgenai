Description
-----------

This CLI plugin is used for managing plugin bundles. It enables one to
easily view a list of available bundles and install or remove them from
the webgen website.

First of all you have to update the local list of available repositories
by using the `update` sub command. After that you can list the available
repositories and their bundles using the `list` sub command. When you
have decided which plugin bundle you want to install, you need to invoke
the `install` sub command with the name of the bundle. If you don't need
a specific bundle anymore, use the `remove` sub command to removed the
bundle.
