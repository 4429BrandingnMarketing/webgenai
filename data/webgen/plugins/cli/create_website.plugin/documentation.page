Description
-----------

This CLI plugin creates a new webgen website based on the specified
website template and website style.

A website template contains page files and other files from which you
can start. For example, the website template 'personal' includes the
most common found page files for a personal site, like an about or hobby
page.

A website style defines the appearance of the website, ie. how the page
looks like, where the menu is, how many columns are used and so
on. Don't worry if you don't like the website style you initially
specified; it can later be easliy changed by using the
Cli/Commands/UseStyle plugin.
