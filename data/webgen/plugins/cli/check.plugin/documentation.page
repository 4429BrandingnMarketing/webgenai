Description
-----------

This CLI plugin checks several things:

*    Configuration file

     The configuration file is checked if its syntax is valid and if all
     parameters/plugins specified are valid.

*    Plugin availability

     Tries to load all plugins and shows information about the plugins
     which fail to load and the reason why they fail to load. If you
     haven't installed all optional libraries, some plugins will surely
     fail to load. However, these failures can be ignored since this is
     intentional.

If something isn't working as expected, one can use these checks to
verify the basic state of the webgen website.
