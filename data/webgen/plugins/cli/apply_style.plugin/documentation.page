Description
-----------

This CLI plugin applies a specific style to a website. One just needs to
specify the style type and the style name. A list of all available
styles is shown on the help output for the command.

Each style is a complete webgen website which gets copied over the
destination website. This allows great freedom when creating a
style. For example, it is easy to apply a website style to a webgen
website, ie. a style that changes the default layout and appearance of a
website. However, as styles can potentially include plugin bundles, not
only the appearance of a website can be changed but also the
functionality. This is used, for example, in the gallery style 'slides'
(TODO:make sure gallery style slides is in distribution).

To differentiate styles based on what they want to achieve, they are
categorized by style types. The best known style type is the website
style which changes the default layout of a webgen website.
