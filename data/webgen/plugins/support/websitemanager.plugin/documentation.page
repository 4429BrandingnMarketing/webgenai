The Support/WebsiteManager plugin provides methods for working with
webgen websites as well as some website templates and website
styles.

Currently, the following actions are supported:

* creating a website based on a website template
* copying a style to an existing website

A website template defines some initial pages which should be filled
with real data. For example, the @project@ template defines several
pages which are useful for software projects including a features and
about page.

A style defines, for example, the basic page layout (in the case of
website styles) or how image galleries should look like (in the case of
gallery styles). So styles are basically used to change the appearance
of parts (or the whole) website. This makes them a powerful tool as this
plugin makes it easy to change a style later!

Styles and website templates are defined using resources. Each such
resource has to be a directory containing an optional README file in
YAML format in which key-value pairs provide additional information
about the style or website template. All other files/directories in the
directory are copied to the root of the destination webgen website when
the style or website template is used.

The plugin uses a special naming convention to recognize website
templates and styles:

* A resource named @webgen/website/template/TEMPLATE_NAME@ is considered
  to be a website template called TEMPLATE_NAME and can be later
  accessed using this name.

* A resource named @webgen/website/style/CATEGORY/STYLE_NAME@ is
  considered to be a style in the category CATEGORY called
  STYLE_NAME. There are no fixed categories, one can use anything here!
  Again, the style can later be accessed by providing the category and
  style name.

Website template names have to be unique and style names have to be
unique in respect to their categories!

Note: all styles in the category 'website' are website styles.
