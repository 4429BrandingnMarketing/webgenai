Description
-----------

This file handler plugin copies files from the source to the output
directory, optionally running a content processor over the content. This
is useful, for example, for CSS stylesheets, javascript files and
images.

All files that match the File/CopyHandler:paths parameter are handled by
this plugin. If the first dot-separated part of the file extension
contains the name of a content processor, this processor is run over the
content of the file before it is written to the output directory. For
example, a file named `hello.jpg` just gets copied verbatimly but a file
named `usage.erb.html` gets preprocessed by the ContentProcessor/Erb
plugin and written to a file named `usage.html` in the output
directory. As you can see in this example, the processor name gets
stripped from the file extension.

If you want to use a specific content processor for processing a file,
have a look at its plugin documentation which shows the unique
identification string that needs to be used in the file extension.
