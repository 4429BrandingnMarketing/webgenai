Description
-----------

Basically, this file handler plugin just copies files from the source to
the output directory. However, it supports two operation modes:

* All files that match the File/CopyHandler:erbPaths parameter are
  processed with ERB and then written out. The leading letter `r` is
  stripped from the extension (e.g. `.rhtml` becomes `.html`) in the
  output file name. During processing with ERB the current `node` object
  is available. This operation mode is useful, for example, for `.rhtml`
  files (HTML with embedded ruby) or `.rcss` files (CSS files with
  embedded ruby).

* All files that match the File/CopyHandler:paths parameter are copied
  from the source to the output directory without modification. This is
  useful, for example, for CSS stylesheets, javascript files and images.

When a file matches against both parameters, it is handled as if it
matches only against File/CopyHandler:erbPaths, i.e. it is processed
with ERB.
