Description
-----------

The feed handler uses input files in WebPage Format which provide the
needed information for generating an ATOM or RSS feed.

Following is an overview of all the meta information keys which are used
by the plugin and the default templates:

Mandatory keys:

* baseURL: The base URL of the website.
* author:  The author of the feed.
* description: A short description of the feed.
* pages: A pattern (or an array of patterns) which describes the pages
         that should be included in the feed

Optional keys:

* title: The title of the feed.
* link: The LCN of a node that represents the feed.
* image: The LCN of an image that represents the feed.
* rss: An RSS feed is created if this is set to `true`.
* atom: An ATOM feed is created if this is set to `true`.
* rss\_version: The version of RSS that should be used.
* numberOfItems: The number of items that should appear in the feed.

The feed handler creates the feeds using templates. If these included
templates don't fit your needs, you can override them on a feed by feed
basis by specifying blocks called `rss_template` and/or `atom_template`
in the feed file.
