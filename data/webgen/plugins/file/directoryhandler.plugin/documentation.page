Description
-----------

The directory handler is used for handling directories, ie. it creates
the target directories.  Additionally an index file for each directory
can be specified which is used instead of the plain directory index for
displaying purposes. This means that when the directory path is resolved
(e.g. by the Tag/Relocatable plugin) the index file is returned.

The name of the index file is specified with the `indexFile` meta
information on a directory node which has a global default provided by
the directory handle. For information on how to override the default
value have a look at the Core/FileHandler#metainfo documentation!

The title for a directory can be set via the `title` meta information on
the directory itself.  However, if the directory has an index file, the
meta information `directoryName` of the index file is used for the
directory title. This allows to have correctly localized directory
names.

Normally, webgen shows a warning if it could not find the directory
index file for a directory.  However, there are most certainly
directories which should not have an index file, e.g. a directory with
only images. To prevent webgen from displaying warnings for such
directories, you can set a null index file using the meta information
backing file:

    dirWithOnlyImages:
      indexFile: ~

This will prevent webgen from showing warnings because you explicitly
define a null index file. This can also be done globally in the
configuration file!
