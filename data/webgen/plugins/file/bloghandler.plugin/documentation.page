The blog file handler is used for creating a blog like interface to a
collection of page files. It can generate month and year archives and
associate RSS or atom feeds.

Blog files are in WebPage Format and the following meta information keys
are used:

* `pages`: An array of path patterns that are used to find the entries
  for the blog.

* `mainPageTemplate`: The name of the template used for creating the
  main page. If not specified, the default main template is used.

* `entryTemplate`: The name of the template used for creating a blog
  entry. If not specified, the default entry template is used.

* `createMainPage`: Specifies whether a blog main page with recent
  entries should be created.

* `createMonthArchive`: Specifies whether a month archive should be
  created.

* `createYearArchive`: Specifies whether a year archive should be
  created.

* `createFeeds`: A list of feed types (`atom`, `rss`) to create for the
  main page and the archive pages.

* `nrOfEntriesOnMainPage`: Specifies the number of recent entries that
  should be shown on the main page.

TODO:
* how to set author for all blog pages via meta information file
* how to style the blog (via main/entry template), blog pages have to
  be styled separately...
