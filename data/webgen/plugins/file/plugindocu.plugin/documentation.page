Description
-----------

This file handler plugin creates documentation pages for plugins. The
handled files need to be in WebPage Format. Two meta information keys
are used:

* `plugins`: One or more regular expressions pattern which specify the
  plugins for which a documentation page should be created.

* `generateIndexPage`: Set this key to the name of the file (without an
  extension) which should hold an index of the generated plugin
  documentation pages.

The appearance of the plugin documentation pages and of the index page
can be customized in two ways:

* This plugin uses the resources `webgen/plugindocu/template` for the
  plugin documentation pages and `webgen/plugindocu/index` for the index
  page. Both resources need to be valid page files and need to have a
  `content` block (because only this one is used). Therefore you can
  change the default style by overriding these resources.

* Since the files handled by this plugin need to be in WebPage Format,
  you can embed the customized templates directly. You need to use the
  block name `template` for overriding the appearance of the plugin
  documentation pages and the block name `index` for overriding the
  appearance of the index page.
