Description
-----------

The configuration plugin provides a place for all the parameters which
do not belong to a specific plugin, like the default language setting.

It also provides support for "custom variables" through the
Core/Configuration:customVars parameter. This facility can be used to
store and access global variables that have been defined in the
configuration file through, for example, ERB code or the Tag/CustomVar
plugin.
