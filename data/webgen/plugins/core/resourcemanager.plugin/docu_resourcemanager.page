Description
-----------

The ResourceManager plugin provides access to plugin resources, which
are shipped with webgen, and special memory resources. For example, the
webgen logo and the webgen-generated-by image are regarded as resources
by webgen.

A resource can either be included directly which means that the content
of the resource is written into the output file. Or it can be referenced
in which case only the path is written into the output file and the
content of the resource itself is written to its predefined output
path. Be aware that a resource is *only* written to its output path if
it is referenced at least once (for example, by the Tag/Resource
plugin)!

A list of all available resources can be found at the Resource Reference
page (TODO:link).
