Description
-----------

The DefaultHandler is the base plugin for all file handler plugins. It
is also used to hold the parameters that apply to all file handler
plugins and it provides default implementations for some methods as well
as the functionality to specify path patterns that are later used to
match files to file handler plugins.

Users normally only have to concern themselves with the parameters of
this plugin. If you want to develop a file handler plugin, have a look
at the RDoc documentation for this plugin class.
