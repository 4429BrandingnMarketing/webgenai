Description
-----------

The FileHandler plugin is the main plugin of webgen. When running webgen
it is responsible for traversing the source directory and creating the
internal representation of all handled files as well as writing the
output files by using the individual file handler plugins. These file
handler plugins reside in the File/ namespace. Additionally, the
FileHandler is responsible for managing the meta information backing
file.

There are many different file handler plugins available, ranging from
very simple ones, like copying a file verbatim from the source to the
output directory, to complicated ones, like creating HTML files from
page files or creating whole image galleries from a simple gallery
definition file!
