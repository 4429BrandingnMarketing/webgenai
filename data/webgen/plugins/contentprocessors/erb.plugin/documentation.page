Description

This processer uses ERB to process content. For detailed information
about ERB have a look at its documentation by executing @ri ERB@ or the
ruby documentation site at http://www.ruby-doc.org/!

You can use the following special objects in your ERB code:

* @ref_node@: The reference node which is the source of the ERB code
  that is executed.
* @node@: The node that gets currently rendered.
* @chain@: The whole node chain.

Here is a small usage example:

  Adding 5 items dynamically:
  <% for i in 1..5 %>
    * item <%= i %>
  <% end %>

The second line shows the first form of the ERB tags which executes Ruby
code but does not output anything: it just starts a @for@ loop. On the
third line the second form of ERB tags is used to output the result of
the Ruby code (note the equation sign!). And the fourth line completes
the @for@ loop by adding the needed @end@ keyword.
