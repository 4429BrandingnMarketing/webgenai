Description
-----------

This processor replaces special xml tags with rendered blocks. It is
used, for example, in templates to define the place where the actual
page content should be.

The syntax is as follows:

    <webgen:block name='BLOCK_NAME' />

where `BLOCK_NAME` is the name of the block of the next node in the node
chain to include (if there is only one node left in the node chain that
node is used). The content of the block is not included verbatim but
rendered according to its render pipeline (with the current node removed
from the node chain unless it's the only node left).


Here is a small example: The first file is the file `default.template`

    --- content, pipeline:blocks
    before
    <webgen:block name='content' />
    after

and the second is a page file called `index.page`

    --- content
    The content of the page file.

The rendered file `index.html` will then look like this:

    before
    The content of the page file.
    after
