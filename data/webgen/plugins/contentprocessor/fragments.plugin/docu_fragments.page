Description
-----------

This processor searches the content for all HTML header tags (`h1` -
`h6`) and stores them in the cache. Be aware that only headers with an
already set id are used. If you are using the `maruku` processor, this
poses no problem since it automatically assigns header ids.

The stored sections are then used on the next webgen run. Therefore
there need to be two webgen runs to ensure that everything has been
handled correctly.
