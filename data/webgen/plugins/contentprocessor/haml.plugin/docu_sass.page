Description
-----------

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in the Sass
meta language, to valid CSS by using the Haml library. For detailed
information about Sass have a look at the [Haml Homepage][1]!

Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in the Sass meta language:

    #main
      :width 90%
      p
        :border-style solid
        :border-color #00f
        a
          :font-weight bold
        a:hover
          :text-decoration underline
