Description
-----------

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in the Haml
markup language, to valid XHTML by using the Haml library. For detailed
information about Haml have a look at the [Haml Homepage][1]!

Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in Haml markup:

    %h1#myid This a h1 header

    %p
      You can just write
      %b your
      paragraphs here and
      %a{:href => 'http://someurl.com'} link
      them below. This is
      %strong nice
      format!

    %blockquote.information
      Citations are easy too.
      Really. And you can assign them attributes.

    %ul
      %li Lists
      %li aren't
      %li difficult
      %li either.
