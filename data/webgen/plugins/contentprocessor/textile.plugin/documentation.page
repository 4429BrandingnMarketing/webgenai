Description
-----------

This processor converts the content, which is assumed to be in Textile
markup, to HTML by using the RedCloth library. For detailed information
about Textile have a look at the [Textile Reference][1]!

Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in Textile markup:

    h1(#myid). This a h1 header

    You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
    "link":http://someurl.com them below. This is also
    **nice** format!

    <blockquote class='information>
    Citations are easy too.
    Really. And you can assign them attributes.
    </blockquote>

    * Lists
    * aren't
    * difficult
    * either.
