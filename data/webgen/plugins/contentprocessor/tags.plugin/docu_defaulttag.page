Description
-----------

The DefaultTag can/should be used as the base plugin for tag plugins. It
provides a default implementation of all the functionality needed by
ContentProcessor/Tags and therefore provides a quicker way for creating
a tag plugin.

For information on how to create such a tag plugin have a look at the
API documentation of the class Tag::DefaultTag.
