Description
-----------

This processer uses ERB to process content. For detailed information
about ERB have a look at its documentation by executing `ri ERB` or the
[ruby documentation site](http://www.ruby-doc.org/)!

You can use the following special objects in your ERB code:

* `ref_node`: The reference node which is the source of the ERB code
  that is executed. Should be used, for example, for resolving paths.

* `node`: The node that gets currently rendered. Should be used for
  retrieving meta information.

* `dest_node`: The node in which the result gets inserted. Should be
  used for calculating relative paths.

* `chain`: The whole node chain.

* `used_nodes`: An array of nodes that can be filled by the ERB code to
  state which nodes have been used (later used for checking if the
  content needs to be re-rendered).

Here is a small usage example:

    Adding 5 items dynamically:
    <% for i in 1..5 %>
      * item <%= i %>
    <% end %>

    Outputting all meta information:
    <% node.meta_info.each do |k,v| %>
      * <%= k %> = <%= v %>
    <% end %>

The second line shows the first form of the ERB tags which executes Ruby
code but does not output anything: it just starts a `for` loop. On the
third line the second form of ERB tags is used to output the result of
the Ruby code (note the equation sign!). And the fourth line completes
the `for` loop by adding the needed `end` keyword.
