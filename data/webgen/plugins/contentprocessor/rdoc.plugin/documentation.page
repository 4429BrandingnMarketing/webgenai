Example
-------

Here is a short sample of a text in RDoc markup:

    = This a h1 header

    You can just write *your* paragraphs here and
    <a href="http://someurl.com">link</a> them below.
    This is also a _nice_ format!

    <blockquote class='information>
    Citations are easy too.
    Really. And you can assign them attributes.
    </blockquote>

    * Lists
    * aren't
    * difficult
    * either.
