# webgen extension bundle <%= bundle_name %>

TODO: describe the bundle here


# Installation

The easiest way to install this extension bundle is by installing the
corresponding Rubygem:

    gem install webgen-<%= bundle_name %>-bundle

If you don't use Rubygems, copy the folder
`lib/webgen/bundle/<%= bundle_name %>` into your `ext` directory.

After that you just need to tell webgen to use this extension bundle by
adding the following line to your `ext/init.rb` file:

    load("<%= bundle_name %>")
