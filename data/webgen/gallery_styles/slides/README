description:
  A style which uses RMagick to generate a slide background for the thumbnails and
  a collage for the main page, prettier than the default style ;-)
  This style was done after reading an article by Corban Brook on rendering
  collages with Ruby and RMagick.

usage:
  This style uses a layouter plugin for creating the collage and slide backgrounds. Therefore you
  have to explicitly specify in the gallery file that you want to use the layouter slides. The
  plugin also only generates images if they do not exist. So, if there is already a collage image, a
  new one will not be created.

  Thomas Leitner (original collage creation routine by Corban Brook)

plugin files:
  collage.rb
