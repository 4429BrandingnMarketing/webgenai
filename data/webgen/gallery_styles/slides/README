description:
  A style which uses RMagick to generate a slide background for the thumbnails and
  a collage for the main page, prettier than the default style ;-)
  This style was done after reading an article by Corban Brook on rendering
  collages with Ruby and RMagick.

author:
  Thomas Leitner (original collage creation routine by Corban Brook)

plugin files:
  collage.rb
