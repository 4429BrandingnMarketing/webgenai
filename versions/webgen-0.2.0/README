webgen - a template based web page generator

Copyright (C) 2004 Thomas Leitner

= Description

Webgen can be used to generate web pages from page description and template files. You create one
template file in which you define the layout of your page and where the content should go. After
that you can create page description files in which you only define the content.

When webgen is run it combines the template with each of the page description files and generates
the HTML output files. During this process special tags are substituted so that, for example, a menu
is generated.

= Dependencies

 log4r - http://log4r.sourceforge.net/

= Installation

 $ ruby setup.rb config
 $ ruby setup.rb setup
 $ ruby setup.rb install

Or you could use Rake and substitute the above commands with this:
 $ rake install

Or you could install webgen the "GEM way":
 $ gem install webgen

= Documentation

You can build the documentation by invoking
 $ rake doc

in the root of the package or by running webgen manually in the +doc+ directory:
 $ ruby -I../lib ../bin/webgen

= Example

There is a demo website in the +testsite+ directory. Open a shell and change into it, then execute
+webgen+ to generate the output files. After that have a look at the resulting pages.
